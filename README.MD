## What to do after cloning?

2- Change line 11-19 of the code to your directories. You will need to set up folders yourself. I have included my own paths an example of layout:

<code>
source_dir = "/Users/hazemfahad/Downloads"
dest_dir_music = "/Users/hazemfahad/Downloads/music"
dest_dir_pdf = "/Users/hazemfahad/Downloads/pdf"
dest_dir_videos = "/Users/hazemfahad/Downloads/videos"
dest_dir_images = "/Users/hazemfahad/Downloads/images"
dest_dir_documents = "/Users/hazemfahad/Downloads/documents"
dest_dir_installers = "/Users/hazemfahad/Downloads/installers"
dest_dir_zip = "/Users/hazemfahad/Downloads/zip"
dest_dir_excalidraw = "/Users/hazemfahad/Downloads/excalidraw"
</code>
